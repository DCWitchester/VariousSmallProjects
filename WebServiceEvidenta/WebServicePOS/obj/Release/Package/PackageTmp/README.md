This program will be the main webService for all future Applications that connect to either the VFP DBF of the PosgresSQL DAtabase.

The base VFP Connection will always be extended in function classes
This will leave the base connection free from trash functions unlike in the old versions.

All WebService files will be contained in the WebServices Folder, each new project containing it's own independent service.

This Work Method is to be inposed on all future WebServices and sooner or later I will reunite the existing webServices in one single entity

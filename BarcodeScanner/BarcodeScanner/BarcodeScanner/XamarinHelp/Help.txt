1. Page Navigation

One of the first things to understand about page navigation within xamarin is that the pages are actually placed within a display stack.
The stack is called with push and pop, the page on top always beiing the one displayed.
The stack doesn't exist as default it beiing created by the initialization of the first NavigationPage()
!VERY IMPORTANT => Each NavigationPage creates and can access its own stack so just the main page should be a navigation page
The important thing to not forget is to pass the INavigation from the main page to the children
In this project this is done by the use of the controller which i have found to be a good practice for general use within most applications
In the latest version of .Net Standard you can also use modal navigation but the latest version causes problems with the barcode scanner

2. Xamarin Essentials

On newer android versions it is a pain in the behind to create settings files to be able to save and alter user-specific settings
So because obtaining permisions for the creation of files would take too much effort I have implemented what I considered at that time to be the better option
Xamarin Essential permits me to create permission keys within the app cookies directly in android.
